# NYC-Arrests-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization


Welcome to my project where I dive into the NYPD Arrests Data, sourced from the New York City Open Data platform (NYPD Arrests Data - Historic). This repository showcases my work with both historic and year-to-date datasets, and I’ve used a variety of techniques and tools to uncover insights from this rich dataset. 

Here’s a quick rundown of the tools and techniques I’ve used:

**Dimensional Modeling:** I have structured the data into a meaningful dimensional model to facilitate easy analysis and reporting.

**Data Profiling:** Using Alteryx, I performed data profiling to identify key trends and spot data anomalies that needed attention.

**Data Integration:** I integrated multiple datasets using Talend, allowing for smooth ETL processes to create a unified dataset.

**Data Manipulation:** With SQL Server, I performed detailed data manipulation to clean and shape the data to make it analysis-ready.

**Data Visualization:** I then used Tableau and Power BI to create visually engaging dashboards and charts that tell a story about crime trends, locations, and other key insights.

This project is a journey through the data, and I am excited to share how various tools like SQL, Alteryx, and Talend can be used together to uncover insights in a fun and meaningful way. 
It’s all about transforming raw data into valuable, accessible knowledge!

## **Insights from NYC Arrests Data:**

**Geospatial Analysis:** High arrest concentrations in Manhattan and certain boroughs; indicates potential high crime areas or population density.

**Age Group**: Majority of arrests are in the 25-44 age group, highlighting trends among working-age adults.

**Gender Distribution:** Significant skew toward male arrests, suggesting a gender-based disparity.

**Race Breakdown:** Higher arrests within Black and White Hispanic groups, indicating racial disparities.

**Time Trends:** Arrests show peaks on specific days, useful for identifying patterns linked to events or enforcement actions.

**Borough Insights:** Brooklyn and Queens have the highest arrest counts, which may reflect population size and crime rates.

**Arrest Precincts:** Insights into precinct-level data can help identify regions with higher arrest frequencies and potential areas for intervention.
